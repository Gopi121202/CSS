    <h3>Notice</h3>
    <p>
      Dear Students and Parents,<br /><br />
      We are excited to announce that our school's Annual Day celebration is
      scheduled for December 15th, 2025. This event is a wonderful opportunity
      for students to showcase their talents and for parents to witness the
      vibrant spirit of our school community.<br /><br />
      The Annual Day will feature a variety of performances including dance,
      music, drama, and more. We encourage all students to participate and
      contribute to making this event a memorable one. Rehearsals will begin
      next week, and students are advised to check the notice board for their
      respective practice schedules.<br /><br />
      Parents are invited to attend the event and support their children. The
      program will commence at 10:00 AM in the school auditorium, followed by a
      lunch break and concluding with an awards ceremony in the afternoon.<br /><br />
      We look forward to your enthusiastic participation and support in making
      this Annual Day a grand success.<br /><br />
      Sincerely,<br />
      School Administration
